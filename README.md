# RecursionError in Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python related to recursive functions: the lack of a base case for negative inputs.

The `bug.py` file contains a recursive factorial function that doesn't handle negative input correctly, resulting in a `RecursionError`. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that includes proper input validation.

## How to reproduce the error

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bug.py` using a Python interpreter.
3. Observe the `RecursionError` when attempting to calculate the factorial of a negative number.

## How to fix the error

Refer to the `bugSolution.py` file for the corrected implementation.
